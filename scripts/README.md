# Custom names and translations
## Based on scripts for InF 2.0.0
### Shiv.sz, Shiv2.sz
- Commented all hardcoded names and tooltips.  
- Since renaming items is necessary for some reason, I renamed the hidden Aquaculture Fishing Rods.

### CustomTooltips.zs
- Moved Shivaxi's hardcoded english names to resources/lang/en_us.lang.  
- Adapted the addTooltip function, so it takes a lang key instead of a hardcoded text.  

### UsefulTooltips.zs
- OPTIONAL. Adds useful tooltips for various items, including each fish bait.
