# Custom names and translations
### CustomNamesTooltips.zs
- Replaced Shivaxi's hardcoded english names and tooltips with translatable texts. So if you plan to use this, I suggest commenting all hardcoded stuff on Shiv.zs and Shiv2.zs
- Grave scroll: Replaced default hardcoded description with a translatable one.
- Seeds' "Fertile Seasons" hardcoded texts: Replaced with translatable ones.

### CustomNamesTooltips2.zs (Optional)
- Charm cakes: Replaced hardcoded names with translatable ones.
- Armor Under: Chestplates and Leggings with Ozzy liner MILD, WARM, COOL hardcoded texts replaced with translatable, colored ones.

### UsefulTooltips.zs (Totally optional)
