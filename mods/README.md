# Translatable forks
### [Fishing Made Better](https://github.com/KameiB/fishing-made-better)
- (Forked from fonny's corrections)
  - Added custom Fishes names and descriptions lang keys.
  - Found a way to use a Client-side tooltip function for Fishes tooltips, inspired on fonny's "Shield Break" mod.
  - Fish fillet now includes the lang key of the original fish, so it can be translated.
  - Fish Bucket now uses the fish lang key, so it can be translated.
  - Left original config json files, fishID, etc intact.
- Tested on a private server located inside a virtual machine, tested old worlds with existing fishes, working properly.
